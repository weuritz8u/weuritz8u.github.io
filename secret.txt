Welcome to the Riddle of the Quantum Goose!

Behold! In a land where Tuesdays taste like copper and shadows hum lullabies,
there lives a creature with no name, seven elbows, and one hundred regrets.

It asks:

"If the whisper of a forgotten triangle weighs less than a sneeze from a philosophical potato,
and every fifth umbrella dreams of being a hammerfish, then what color does envy hum when it's upside down on a trampoline of mirrors?"

You have 3.14 guesses.

Clues:
1. The answer is not a number, unless it's thinking about soup.
2. Ignore all doors that bark.
3. Multiply the scent of yesterday by the square root of maybe.
4. Always, never, sometimes.

To solve it, drink tea with a dictionary under a full moon, but only if the spoon says “perhaps.”
